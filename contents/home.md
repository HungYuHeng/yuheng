I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University (NYCU) in December 2025, where I was supervised by Professor [Ping-Chun Hsieh](https://pinghsieh.github.io/). My research focuses on reinforcement learning, Bayesian optimization, and bandit learning. Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Fellow (Incoming) at the Georgia Institute of Technology, working with Professor [Kai Wang](https://guaguakai.com/). Before joining NYCU, I received my B.S. in Computer Science from National Tsing Hua University (NTHU) in 2018.
