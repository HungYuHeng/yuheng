I am currently a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at National Yang-Ming Chiao Tung University (NYCU), supervised by Professor [Ping-Chun Hsieh](https://pinghsieh.github.io/). My research focuses on reinforcement learning, Bayesian optimization, and bandit learning. I am also a visiting scholar at Georgia Tech, advised by Professor [Kai Wang](https://guaguakai.com/). Before joining NYCU, I received my B.S. in Computer Science from National Tsing Hua University (NTHU) in 2018.
